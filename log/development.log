Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nArbitration committee\r\nMain article: Arbitration Committee\r\nThe English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]\r\n\r\nWhen initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][failed verification]\r\n\r\nAs with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23] For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikipedia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]"}, "commit"=>"Save Post"}
